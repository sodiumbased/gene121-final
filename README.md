## Description
This repo contains software for our GENE121 and MTE100 Final Project, which is an cleaning robot with a mop and an array of UV LEDs attatched that navigates autonomously. It is achieved by first scanning the room and mapping out its geometries before cleaning which prevents the robot from being stuck in random loops, provide greater floor area coverage, and clean with an optimal route.
